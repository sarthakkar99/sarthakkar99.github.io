#### DataSet introduction
##### The data set I discovered to be fascinating Songs from the popular play storm in the Kaggle data set that match the criteria for a song duration Acoustic Ness danceability energy Instrumental Ness liveliness loudness tempo time signature. This data set interested me for the following reason: I've always been curious about how music streaming services like Spotify, Amazon Music, and Apple Music operate. I also wanted to learn how popular songs are composed to balance various aspects so that they can appeal to the widest possible audience. By studying how people listen to music, I can learn more about their personalities. It will also assist me in making predictions about the direction the music business will take. I also want to determine which of the aforementioned factors influences the song's popularity the most. #####

##### Data Science Book Introduction
##### I'm mainly interested in learning more about the book Data Intensive Text Processing. This is because it connects text processing, a crucial part of research in the modern world, and big data. He presents MapReduce, a tool that may be used to organize jobs that require a lot of data, in the first chapter. He introduces the text processing difficulties of tokenization and stemming in the second chapter, along with the drawbacks of text processing. In the third chapter, he presents the processes of MapReduce, particularly secondary sorting, which I had never heard of before, and shows how they are beneficial in text-processing tasks. He introduces the MapReduce algorithm's handling of massive data in the fourth chapter. Later chapters addressed complex subjects such as to introducing me to the PageRank and graph algorithms, MapReduce's machine learning framework also exposed me to them, which helped me better grasp how to approach challenging text processing tasks. He attempted to describe the evolution of big data in following chapters. The book that most impressed me was this one, which is a wonderful resource for big data because it offers practical examples and insights when working with real-world applications, in addition to being succinct and delivering a lot of information. #####
